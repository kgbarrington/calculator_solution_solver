This program will solve puzzles from the mobile game "Calculator: The Game"
The goal of the game is to use mathematical operatorations in order to achieve 
a determined value given: a starting value, limited number of moves, 
and predetermined mathematical operations. 

Example: Get to the number 14 starting from 5 using +1 and x2, in three moves.
Soulution: 5 -> +1 -> 6 -> +1 -> 7 -> x2 -> 14

This program takes the initial conditions of the puzzle and finds the solution 
via brute force. It is not optimized, but it gets the job done!

Avoid using non-integer numbers, too many maximum number of moves, and too many operations. Doing
so may produce long calculation times.
